This repository contains a JavaScript file containing code that can be pasted into your browser's console. This code does not require any special access to your Reddit account â€” all it does is identify the comment elements on the UI, finds the context menu (three dots) button, clicks it, clicks the delete button, and then clicks the next delete button to permanently delete the comment. This code works purely on the UI.
